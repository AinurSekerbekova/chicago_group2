 🔹 Frameworks & Libraries for Map Games
 
Leaflet.js
→ lightweight, open-source JS library for interactive maps.
→ great for overlaying historical maps, markers, and quizzes.
→ example plugin: Leaflet Storymaps

Mapbox GL JS (free tier available, but not fully open-source)
→ more polished visuals, works well for styled maps and custom overlays.
→ you could georeference historic Chicago fire maps and let players explore/guess locations.

OpenLayers
→ more powerful than Leaflet, good if you need precise GIS data handling.

Phaser.js (if you want more “gamey” feel)
→ 2D game framework in JS; you can combine with map tiles.
