           Welcome to "Time Traveling Through Chicago," a unique interactive experience that guides you through the dramatic events of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. This game invites you to explore the city's past and present, solve challenges rooted in history, and engage with the voices of those who witnessed one of America's most devastating urban disasters.​

Game Overview
Players journey through modern Chicago, identifying the original locations that played crucial roles during the fire. Each correct guess transforms the cityscape, letting you witness scenes from 1871 and listen to survivor narrations. As you play, you collect seven survivor letters, each telling a piece of Chicago’s collective memory, culminating in a final reward: the iconic Water Tower, a symbol of resilience and remembrance. Throughout your journey, you'll face moral choices, uncover historic clues, and reconstruct scenes of loss, courage, and rebirth.​

Interactive Features
Guess modern and historic Chicago locations using photo clues and maps, traversing past and present.

Experience "time rift" moments, unlocking survivor letters and visual transformations.

Collect letters and piece together the story of Chicago’s destruction and regrowth.​

The Narrators: Meet the Creators
Your journey is guided by four narrators—Ainur, Tarlan, Ehsan, and Tommaso—who are also the creative minds behind the game. Each narrator brings a unique perspective, weaving together historical fact, personal reflection, and interactive storytelling.

Ainur
Ainur animates the story with deep empathy and a sharp eye for historical detail. Expect a narrator who highlights personal struggles and the emotional resilience of Chicagoans.

Tarlan
Tarlan brings technical mastery and a thoughtful narrative voice. As your guide, they encourage you to examine the evidence and make sense of the city’s transformations.

Ehsan
Ehsan’s narration emphasizes discovery and problem-solving. Expect insightful questions, a passion for piecing together evidence, and support as you reconstruct each harrowing event.

Tommaso
Tommaso offers a reflective and philosophical touch, tying individual stories to broader themes of memory and collective survival. The narration helps you think about how past choices echo into the present.

Each narrator appears in-game as an illustrated guide, offering clues, commentary, and encouragement as you uncover Chicago’s hidden history. Together, they provide a richly collaborative voice—bridging the past and present and inviting you to preserve memory, cultivate empathy, and shape your version of the city’s story.​
