        <div class="row fw-bold">
            <p>Welcome to "Time Traveling Through Chicago," a unique interactive experience that guides you through the dramatic events of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.</p>
  <p>
    This game invites you to explore the city's past and present, solve challenges rooted in history, and engage with the voices of those who witnessed one of America's most devastating urban disasters.

  <h3>The Narrators: Meet the Creators</h3>

    Your journey is guided by four narrators: Ainur, Tarlan, Ehsan, and Tommaso; who are also the creative minds behind the game.
    Each narrator brings a unique perspective, weaving together historical fact, personal reflection, and interactive storytelling.
  </p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tarlan:</strong> Brings technical mastery and a thoughtful narrative voice. As your guide, they encourage you to examine the evidence and make sense of the city’s transformations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ehsan:</strong> Emphasizes discovery and problem-solving. Expect insightful questions, a passion for piecing together evidence, and support as you reconstruct each harrowing event.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tommaso:</strong> Offers a reflective and philosophical touch, tying individual stories to broader themes of memory and collective survival. The narration helps you think about how past choices echo into the present.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Each narrator appears in-game as an illustrated guide, offering clues, commentary, and encouragement as you uncover Chicago’s hidden history. Together, they provide a richly collaborative voice—bridging the past and present and inviting you to preserve memory, cultivate empathy, and shape your version of the city’s story.
